# Feature: Team Management System

## Overview
Enable collaborative event management through team-based organization. All event organizers must belong to a team, with seamless invitation mechanisms to build creative communities.

## User Stories

### Core Team Functionality
- **As a new user**, I want to automatically have a default team called "My Team" so I can start creating events immediately
- **As a team owner**, I want to invite collaborators via email so they can help manage our events
- **As a team owner**, I want to generate invitation links so I can easily share team access
- **As an invited user**, I want to receive clear email invitations with team context so I understand what I'm joining
- **As an invited user**, I want to join teams through invitation links so I can quickly become a collaborator

### Team Management
- **As a team member**, I want to see all team members and their roles so I understand our organization
- **As a team owner**, I want to manage member permissions so I can control who can create/edit events
- **As a team member**, I want to leave teams I no longer want to be part of
- **As a team owner**, I want to remove members when necessary to maintain team quality

## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema
```typescript
teams: {
  name: string;
  slug: string; // URL-friendly identifier
  description?: string;
  ownerId: Id<"users">;
  createdAt: number;
}

teamMembers: {
  teamId: Id<"teams">;
  userId: Id<"users">;
  role: "owner" | "admin" | "member";
  joinedAt: number;
}

teamInvitations: {
  teamId: Id<"teams">;
  invitedBy: Id<"users">;
  email: string;
  token: string; // unique invitation token
  role: "admin" | "member";
  status: "pending" | "accepted" | "expired";
  expiresAt: number;
  createdAt: number;
}
```

### API Endpoints

#### Team Management
- `createTeam(name, description?)` - Create new team
- `getMyTeams()` - Get all teams user belongs to
- `getTeamMembers(teamId)` - Get team member list
- `updateTeam(teamId, updates)` - Update team details
- `leaveTeam(teamId)` - Leave a team
- `removeMember(teamId, userId)` - Remove team member

#### Invitations
- `inviteByEmail(teamId, email, role)` - Send email invitation
- `generateInviteLink(teamId, role, expiresIn?)` - Create shareable link
- `acceptInvitation(token)` - Accept invitation via token
- `getPendingInvitations(teamId)` - Get pending invitations
- `cancelInvitation(invitationId)` - Cancel pending invitation

### User Experience Flow

#### Default Team Creation
1. User signs up ‚Üí Automatically create "My Team" with user as owner
2. User can rename default team to match their organization
3. All events initially belong to user's default team

#### Email Invitation Flow
1. Team owner enters email address and selects role
2. System generates unique invitation token
3. Email sent with invitation link containing token
4. Recipient clicks link ‚Üí lands on invitation acceptance page
5. If recipient has account ‚Üí immediate team join
6. If recipient is new ‚Üí sign up flow ‚Üí automatic team join

### Security Considerations
- Invitation tokens expire after 7 days by default
- Email invitations tied to specific email addresses
- Invitation links can have custom expiration (1 hour to 30 days)
- Team owners can revoke pending invitations
- Rate limiting on invitation sends (max 10 per hour per team)

### UI Components Needed
- Team creation modal
- Team settings page with member management
- Invitation modal (email + link generation)
- Pending invitations list
- Team switcher in navigation
- Invitation acceptance page

## Current System Capabilities

The implemented team management system provides:

4. **Public Invitation Access**: Anyone can view invitation details before signing in
5. **Team Management UI**: Full-featured interface for managing teams and members
6. **Permission Validation**: Server-side permission checks for all team operations
7. **File-Based Routing**: Scalable Next.js/Remix-style routing architecture
8. **Development Mode**: Email fallback with console logging for testing

## Missing Features Analysis

### üîç **What's Missing from Original Specification:**

1. **Shareable Link Generation UI** (Phase 3)
   - Currently links are generated and logged to console
   - Missing: Admin UI to copy/share invitation links
   - **Effort**: Small - just UI for displaying/copying the token URL

2. **Custom Link Expiration Settings** (Phase 3)
   - Currently fixed at 7 days
   - Missing: UI to set custom expiration (1 hour to 30 days)
   - **Effort**: Medium - requires UI and backend updates

3. **Rate Limiting** (Security)
   - Specified: "max 10 per hour per team"
   - Missing: Server-side rate limiting implementation
   - **Effort**: Medium - requires tracking invitation counts

4. **Team Branding/Customization** (Phase 4)
   - Missing: Team logos, primary colors, custom branding
   - **Effort**: Large - requires file upload, storage, and UI overhaul

5. **Advanced Role Permissions** (Phase 4)
   - Currently basic owner/admin/member roles
   - Missing: Fine-grained permissions (who can invite, edit events, etc.)
   - **Effort**: Large - requires permission matrix system

6. **Team Analytics** (Phase 4)
   - Missing: Member activity tracking, team statistics
   - **Effort**: Large - requires analytics infrastructure

### ‚úÖ **What We Actually Exceeded:**

1. **Public Invitation Pages** - Better UX than originally specified
2. **File-Based Routing** - More scalable architecture than planned  
3. **Development Mode** - Better testing workflow than specified
4. **Type Safety** - Comprehensive TypeScript implementation
